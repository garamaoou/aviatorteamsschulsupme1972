## Aviator Game Guide: How to Play

The Aviator game is based on simple mechanics but offers the potential
for significant rewards. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to play:

### Step 1: Place Your Bet

When the game starts, you will see a plane ascending on the screen. Your
goal is to place a bet before the plane flies off the screen. You can
place multiple bets in each round, giving you more chances to win.

### Step 2: Cash Out Before the Plane Disappears

The game's challenge is to cash out before the plane flies away. The
longer the plane stays in flight, the higher your multiplier, but if you
wait too long, the plane disappears, and you lose your bet.

### Step 3: Strategy Tips

-   **Timing is Key**: It's crucial to decide the right moment to cash
    out. Cash out too early, and you'll miss bigger wins; wait too long,
    and you risk losing your bet.
-   **Start Small**: When you're just starting, it's best to place
    smaller bets and get a feel for the game's pace.
